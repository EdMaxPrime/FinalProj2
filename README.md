# Portfolio for CSCI 135

The readme for the APCS project is inside the `project` folder. It has instructions for running and using the program. *Note: you need Processing*

The sample c++ program is inside the `cpp` folder.
- open a command prompt
- change into the cpp folder
- type `g++ -o max sample.cpp`
- type `./max`
- it's going to ask you to enter two numbers, so make sure to do that!
